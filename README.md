🌟 Hey there! I’m Boyan — driven by curiosity, motivated by challenges, and always building real, functional projects. I love learning new technologies, solving problems, and turning ideas into solutions that make an impact. Right now I'm exploring everything from full-stack development to experimenting with low-level systems. If something sparks my interest, I dive into it and learn fast.

<strong>📚 CURRENTLY LEARNING</strong>

Python (in school) and Rust (just starting out) 

<strong>🌎 FEATURED PROJECT - SHAREDTRAVELLING (NAMED TESTPROJECT)</strong>

A website where people can create and find shared travel plans.
The idea: connect people going to the same destination → split costs → make travel cheaper and more social.

<strong>🎯 A Little About Me</strong>

I’ve always been the kind of person who picks up new hobbies — and gets good at them fast.

Some things I’ve done over the years include drawing (especially manga style), competing with Rubik’s cubes, math competitions, karate, calisthenics and a bit of photography.
