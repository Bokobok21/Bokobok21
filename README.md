🌟 Hey there! I’m Boyan — driven by curiosity, motivated by challenges, and always building real, functional projects. I love learning new technologies, solving problems, and turning ideas into solutions that make an impact. Right now I'm exploring everything from full-stack development to experimenting with low-level systems. If something sparks my interest, I dive into it and learn fast.

📚 Currently Learning

Python (in school) and Rust (just starting out)

Pursued drawing (especially manga style)
Competed with Rubik’s cubes
Participated in math competitions
Trained karate, calisthenics, and went to the gym
Did photography a while back
