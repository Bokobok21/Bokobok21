🌟 Hey there! I'm Boyan
Software Engineering student @ TU • Web Dev Enthusiast • Always Learning

I’m Boyan (Bokobok21), a first-year Computer & Software Engineering student at TU.
I love building things that solve real problems — my first big project was a .NET web app that helps people organize shared travelling, reducing cost by connecting travelers going to the same place.

Right now I'm exploring everything from full-stack development to Linux customization.
If something sparks my interest, I dive into it and learn fast.

🎯 A Little About Me

I’ve always been the kind of person who picks up new hobbies — and gets good at them fast.

Some things I’ve done over the years:

Competed with Rubik’s cubes

Participated in math competitions (even won a gold medal in 5th grade)

Trained karate, calisthenics, and went to the gym

Tried photography and drawing

Currently addicted to customizing and ricing my Linux setup

I like challenges. They make learning fun.
